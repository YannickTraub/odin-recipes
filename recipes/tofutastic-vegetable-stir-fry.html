        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a incredibly tasty and easy to make vegetable stir-fry with tofu on a rich-bodied soy sauce base.<br>
                It is a staple recipe in my collection and a fan-favorite among friends and family.</p>
            <p>The vegetables included here are my personal favorites and fit the flavor profile well, but it's perfectly fine to add others.<br>
                The savory tofu gives it some good crunch and adds vegan-friendly proteins while the soy sauce gives it the umami flavor</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>2 Zucchinis</li>
                <li>4 Carrots</li>
                <li>1 Spring Onion</li>
                <li>1 Onion</li>
                <li>4 Gloves garlic</li>
                <li>400g Smoked Tofu</li>
                <li>120g Jasmin Rice</li>
                <li>Turmeric, cumin, pepper, ground coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, chili flakes </li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Cooking oil</li>
                <li>Peanut oil</li>
                <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the vegetables, peel if necessary, and slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the onion and garlic.</li>
                <li>Wrap tofu in paper towels and press out the water. Then cut into bite-sized cubes.</li>
                <li>Heat some oil in a large (wok) pan and add the carrots.
                    <ul>
                    <li>After a while, add onion and garlic and sauté briefly.</li>
                    <li>Finally, add zucchini and spring onion, and cook everything over medium heat until desired tenderness.</li>
                    <li>Season the vegetables with cumin, coriander, pepper, and a generous amount of turmeric.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> If the vegetables brown too quickly but aren't yet tender, deglaze with a bit of water or vegetable broth and let simmer until done.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in another pan and fry the tofu cubes over medium to high heat for 6-8 minutes.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Don't stir too often so a crust can form.</li>
                    <li>After about halfway through, season with salt, pepper, turmeric, and cumin, and finish cooking over medium heat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cook the rice in parallel.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked tofu to the cooked vegetables, mix well, and optionally season again with turmeric, pepper, coriander, and a bit of peanut oil.</li>
                <li>Deglaze over low heat with soy sauce, then season with nutmeg, cinnamon, and chili flakes.</li>
                <li>Serve the “Tofutastic Vegetable Stir-Fry” over Asian grains with a red or rose wine of your choice.</li>
