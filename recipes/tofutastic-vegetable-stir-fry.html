    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a incredibly tasty and easy to make vegetable stir-fry with tofu on a rich-bodied soy sauce base.<br>
    It is a staple recipe in my collection and a fan-favorite with friends and family.</p>
    <p>The vegetables included here are my favorites and fit the flavor profile well, but it's perfectly fine to add even more. The tofu gives it some good crunch and adds vegan-friendly proteins.</p>
